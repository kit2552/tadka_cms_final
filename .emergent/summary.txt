<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial user request was to load the application from a repository and connect it to a remote MongoDB database.

Subsequently, the user made numerous requests via chat to add features and fix bugs across the web application. The core requirements were:
1.  **Replicate Functionality:** Apply a standard set of features (from the  page) to multiple new and existing pages. This includes:
    *   Default filter set to Latest.
    *   A limit of 20 posts per page.
    *   A compact loading modal instead of a full-screen loader.
    *   Scroll restoration (remembering scroll position when navigating back from an article).
2.  **Create New Pages:** Build new pages for various content categories and link them from the homepage.
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
3.  **Refactor & Rename:**
    *   Rename the  page and URL to .
    *   Update tab labels (e.g., Bollywood to Hindi, TV to TV Spotlight).
4.  **Styling Fixes:**
    *   Adjust component layouts (e.g., 2-column grids).
    *   Correctly display vertical images without cropping the top.
    *   Style post cards to match various user-provided examples (e.g., with play icons, title overlays).
    *   Remove unwanted icons from subtitles.
5.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fix broken image thumbnails on gallery pages.
    *   Ensure pages fetch real data from the correct API endpoints, removing mock data.
    *   Resolve incorrect navigation links on More buttons.
    *   Fix JSX and routing errors that resulted in blank pages.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack news/media portal with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The agent has performed extensive work on the frontend, creating several new pages, refactoring existing ones, and applying a consistent set of features (filtering, loading, scroll restoration) and styling across the application. Most of the user's requests have been addressed, but some bugs and final implementations are still pending.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was addressing multiple issues on the  page. The user reported that the More button on the homepage linked to the wrong page, the tab labels were incorrect (Bollywood instead of Reels), and no posts were loading. The agent was in the process of updating the component () with the correct link and updating the page () with the correct tab labels and data fetching logic for the 'tadka shorts' and 'tadka shorts bollywood' categories.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent. The agent should verify that: 1. Clicking the More button on the homepage's Tadka Pics section navigates to . 2. The tabs on the  page are labeled Tadka Shorts and Reels. 3. Articles are correctly loaded under both tabs.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  page is not working correctly (P0)
  - Issue 2: Image thumbnails are not loading on the  page (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has used  to:
        1.  Update the  in  to point to .
        2.  Update the tab labels in .
        3.  Update the category slugs used for fetching data in .
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1.  View the modified files ( and ) to confirm the changes are correct.
        2.  Restart the frontend service: frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started.
        3.  Manually test the More button link and the  page to see if data loads correctly.
        4.  If data still doesn't load, check the backend  to confirm the exact category slugs for Tadka Shorts are  and .
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To make the Tadka Shorts feature fully functional as requested by the user.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent previously attempted a fix by adding  to image classes and adding extensive  statements to debug the  helper function in . The user reported the issue persists.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1.  The agent should not try another blind fix. First, instruct the agent to use the browser's developer tools (via screenshot or asking the user) to inspect the console logs that were previously added.
        2.  Examine the network response for the API calls fetching data for this page.
        3.  Compare the structure of the  array in the API response with the code that accesses it in the  function. The issue is likely a mismatch in property names (e.g.,  vs ).
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a gallery page, and its primary function is to display images. Fixing it is critical to the page's purpose.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Resolved multiple critical JSX syntax errors and missing routes that caused blank pages after bulk edits.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
This is covered by the **All Pending/In progress Issue list**. The primary unfixed issue is the non-loading thumbnails on the  page.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Stack**: React, FastAPI, MongoDB.
-   **Frontend**: Modern React with hooks (, , , ). All styling is done via Tailwind CSS. Client-side routing is managed by .
-   **Backend**: A single-file () FastAPI application handles all API logic and database interactions using .
-   **Core Pattern**: A significant portion of the work involved cloning the logic from  to serve as a template for other content pages.

**key DB schema**
-   **articles**: 
    - The schema is flexible, with  and  used interchangeably. The code handles both.
    - Some articles have a , while others have a  array for images.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**

    -   
-   **Heavily Modified**:
    -   : For adding routes for all new pages.
    -   : For adding back-navigation logic for all new pages.
    -   : Major feature and styling updates.
    -   , , : Feature replication and bug fixing.
-   **Deleted**:
    -    (replaced by )

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Duplicated Page Logic**: The logic for fetching, filtering, loading, and scroll restoration is copied across more than 8 different page components. This should be extracted into a single reusable custom hook (e.g., ) to drastically reduce code duplication and simplify maintenance.
-   **Inconsistent API Calls**: Some API calls are made directly within components'  hooks, while others are abstracted into . A consistent approach should be enforced, with all data fetching logic residing in the service layer.

**key api endpoints**
-   Generic Category Fetch: 
-   Homepage Section Fetch (uses different slugs):
    -    (corresponds to )
    -   
    -   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Replication Pattern**: When asked to create a new content page, your default strategy should be to copy the entire file content from  and adapt it. This includes state variables,  hooks, and filter logic.
-   **Scroll Restoration**: Implementing scroll restoration is a recurring task. It involves: 1) Saving  to  in the  function. 2) Using  to check for  in a  to restore the scroll position. 3) Updating  to handle back navigation for the new page type.
-   **Category Slug Mismatch**: Be aware that category slugs used for homepage sections (e.g., ) can be different from the slugs used on the main category pages (e.g., ). Always verify the correct slug in  if data fails to load.
-   **Build Errors**: The agent has previously introduced multiple JSX syntax errors and missing routes after making bulk changes, leading to blank pages. After any significant edits, especially to JSX structure or routing, double-check the closing tags and ensure all necessary routes are present in .

**documents created in this job**
- None.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**:
    -   : Image thumbnails are not loading, showing a fallback image instead. This is a recurring, unfixed bug.
    -   : Currently non-functional (wrong link, wrong labels, no data). This is the immediate task.
-   **Mocked**: None. The agent has successfully replaced mock data with live API calls.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions:
    -   The  thumbnail issue was reported again after an attempted fix.
    -   The agent introduced build-breaking JSX errors and routing issues on multiple occasions, which required user intervention to identify and fix.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A. The application is publicly accessible and does not require login for the features being worked on.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has not used the  or  despite facing recurring bugs ( thumbnails) and introducing build-breaking errors, which goes against the system prompt guidelines for repeated failures.
-   The agent did not perform a final self-verification after applying the last set of fixes to the three topic pages (, etc.), which led to the user discovering the missing routes. A quick check of the preview URL would have caught the blank pages.</analysis>
