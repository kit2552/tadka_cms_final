# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "I've completed comprehensive testing of all backend API endpoints after the PoliticalNews component height increase from 635px to 645px. All backend functionality remains intact and is working correctly. The health check endpoint (/api/) returns status 200 with the message 'Blog CMS API is running' and status 'healthy'. The Articles API (/api/articles) successfully returns all 61 articles with proper pagination. The Categories API (/api/categories) returns all 12 categories correctly. The database connectivity is working properly as evidenced by successful data retrieval across all endpoints. The Movie Reviews API and Featured Images API are functioning correctly. CORS configuration is properly set up with appropriate headers. The analytics tracking endpoint successfully processes tracking data. The view count increment functionality for articles is working as expected. No issues were found with any backend functionality after the UI height changes to the PoliticalNews component."

      message: "✅ GALLERY POST FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETED: I have thoroughly tested the gallery post functionality and backend APIs as requested. **Key Findings:** 1) **Gallery API Endpoints Working**: GET /api/galleries returns 4 galleries successfully, individual gallery retrieval working, proper 404 error handling for invalid IDs, pagination working correctly. 2) **Data Structure Issues Identified**: Gallery images currently stored as base64 data with fields (id, name, data, size) instead of expected URL/alt/caption structure needed by frontend GalleryPost component. 3) **Article-Gallery Integration**: No articles currently have gallery associations - no gallery_id fields or gallery objects found in article responses. 4) **Backend API Validation**: All endpoints functional with proper error handling, CORS configuration working, pagination parameters working correctly. 5) **Frontend Compatibility**: Current gallery data structure incompatible with GalleryPost component expectations - needs URL/alt/caption format for image slider functionality. **Recommendations**: Gallery image structure needs updating to use URL/alt/caption format, articles need gallery_id associations, but backend API infrastructure is solid and ready for proper gallery data integration."
